# RESTful API with TypeScript and Express.js

The following project implements a RESTful API that allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a set of users and messages stored in a database. It also takes into account some best practices for a production-ready solution.

## Technologies used

- **Node.js:** The runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the server side.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript, providing static typing and object-oriented capabilities, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- **Express.js:** A minimalist web framework for Node.js, designed for building web applications and APIs. It simplifies the server creation process that is already available in Node. In this project, Express.js facilitates the routing, handling HTTP requests, and crafting responses.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful, open-source relational database system used for data persistence in this application.
- Docker
